If both values are provided an input in the configuration file, they will compete, and the winning result is the one with the smallest number of added pixels.</p> <p>The reason for the competition is an attempt to conserve mask topology i.e. any small holes it has which may become closed upon dilation / gaussian blurring. The dilation method seems to work best for larger masks where there are more mask pixels, and the gaussian smoothing better when there are small holes.</p> <p>In addition, this smoothing step also tries to preserve mask topology by re-adding any holes back into the mask that lie within the <code>holearea_min_max</code> threshold.

The skeletonisation methods are handled by the <code>tracing/skeletonize.py</code> module.</p> <p></p> <p>We have found that by including the height information into the skeletonisation process and removing the lowest <code>height_bias</code> percent, we can bias the skeleton to lie on the DNA backbone and generate a better representation of the molecule, especially at crossing points and regions where the mask is less accurate.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"advanced/disordered_tracing/#3-pruning","title":"3. Pruning","text":"<p>Pruning is the act of removing spurious branches from a skeleton which does not follow the underlying masks' shape. To this end, TopoStats provides a variety of methods and parameters to help clean up the skeletons.</p> <p></p> <p>Pruning can be done by branch length (using the <code>max_length</code> configuration parameter) and / or the branch height (using the <code>height_threshold</code>, <code>method_values</code> and <code>method_outliers</code> configuration parameters).</p> <p>Length pruning is the simplest, iteratively comparing the length (in nm) of each branch containing an endpoint with the <code>max_length</code> parameter. If it's length is below this value, it is deemed as a spurious branch and removed, along with any junction pixels until a single-pixel skeleton remains.</p> <p>Height pruning also iteratively compares the branches pixel values (height) to a <code>height_threshold</code> parameter, again, any branch heights which are below this value are pruned. However, as there are multiple pixels in a branch, we provide different methods to obtain a single branch height value for comparison i.e. <code>method_values</code>:</p> <ul> <li><code>min</code> - the minimum value of all the branch pixel values.</li> <li><code>median</code>- the median value of all the branch pixel values.</li> <li><code>mid</code> - the middle value (averaged if two) of the ordered branch pixels. This is particularly useful for pruning false   bridges where the height dips in the middle of the branch.</li> </ul> <p>Additionally, how these branch height values compare to the <code>height_threshold</code> is also considered i.e <code>method_outliers</code>:</p> <ul> <li><code>abs</code> - prunes branch values below the absolute value of the <code>height_threshold</code>.</li> <li><code>mean_abs</code> - prunes branch values below the whole skeleton mean pixel value - absolute threshold. This is useful for   non-surface samples or periodic structures e.g. in DNA we expect the mean height to be around 2nm, but high resolution   imaging may cause this to dip to 0.8nm (the depth of a major groove), so we'd want to prune branch heights below this.</li> <li><code>iqr</code> - prunes branch values below 1.5x inter-quartile range (IQR) of all the branches.

Using these upper and\n        lower hulls, the callipers are simulated as rotating clockwise around the grain.\n        We determine the order in which vertices are encountered by comparing the\n        gradients of the slopes between vertices. An array of pairs of points that\n        are in contact with either calliper at a given time is created in order to\n        be able to calculate the maximum feret diameter. The minimum diameter is a\n        little tricky, since it won't simply be the shortest distance between two\n        contact points, but it will occur somewhere during the rotation around a\n        pair of contact points. It turns out that the point will always be such\n        that two points are in contact with one calliper while the other calliper\n        is in contact with another point. We can use this fact to be sure of finding\n        the smallest feret diameter, simply by testing each triangle of 3 contact points\n        as we iterate, finding the height of the triangle that is formed between the\n        three aforementioned points, as this will be the perpendicular distance between\n        the callipers.\n\n        References\n        ----------\n        [1] Graham, R.L.

More iterations can improve scar removal by tidying up remaining artefacts after removal, though will cause more data distortion. <code>threshold_low</code> float <code>0.250</code> The threshold determining whether to further assess if a pixel is a scar. This is the first check, and lowering it will allow more pixels to undergo further analysis in determining if they are scars. <code>threshold_high</code> float <code>0.666</code> The threshold above which a pixel ridge is automatically determined to be a scar. Lowering this value will increase the number of pixels that are flagged as scars with no additional checks. <code>max_scar_width</code> int <code>4</code> The maximum thickness of scars in pixels, along their short axis, ie vertical distance in an AFM image.
